To analyze sentiment in software engineering (SE) texts, the proposed SEntiMoji approach leverages emoji usage as noisy sentiment labels. This method combines data from both social media (like Twitter) and technical platforms (like GitHub) to capture general sentiment patterns and technical jargon. The process involves two main stages: first, fine-tuning a pre-trained representation model (DeepMoji) using emoji-labeled texts from GitHub to incorporate domain-specific knowledge; second, using this fine-tuned model to generate sentiment-aware vector representations of labeled SE-related texts, which are then used to train a sentiment classifier. This approach significantly improves sentiment analysis performance in SE by effectively utilizing both general and technical sentiment expressions, addressing the limitations of traditional sentiment analysis tools that often struggle with technical jargon.
