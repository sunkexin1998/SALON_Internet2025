Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial in software engineering sentiment analysis because technical texts often contain jargon and code snippets that do not convey sentiment. Accurate sentiment analysis requires focusing on expressive language to avoid misinterpretation and ensure relevant insights into developer sentiments.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering, the paper suggests several preprocessing steps. These include removing code snippets and programming keywords that do not convey sentiment, expanding contractions, and handling emoticons to reflect their sentiment polarity. Additionally, the authors implement negation preprocessing to accurately capture sentiment in negated contexts. By focusing on relevant expressive language and filtering out technical jargon, the analysis can better identify sentiments in code review comments, ensuring that the sentiment analysis tool effectively captures the developers' emotional responses.
