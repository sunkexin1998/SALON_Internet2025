In software engineering texts, sentiment expression differs from general domains due to the presence of code snippets, specific terminologies, and emojis. Developers often express positive sentiments towards individuals (e.g., gratitude) and negative sentiments towards projects (e.g., frustration), reflecting their collaborative and technical context.

To analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, the paper suggests several preprocessing steps: removing non-English characters, expanding contractions, and eliminating code snippets, URLs, and quotations. It also emphasizes stop words removal and processing emoticons and punctuation marks to capture sentiment accurately. Additionally, negation marking is applied to adjust sentiment meanings. Feature vectorization methods like TF-IDF and Doc2Vec are used to represent the texts, followed by supervised machine learning classifiers for sentiment classification. The entity recognition process identifies sentiments directed towards specific individuals or projects, enhancing the analysis's relevance to the software engineering context.
