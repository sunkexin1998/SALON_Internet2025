To analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, the paper introduces SentiStrength-SE, a domain-specific sentiment analysis tool. The process involves creating a tailored domain dictionary that captures the unique emotional expressions and technical jargon used in software engineering. This dictionary is developed through qualitative studies and manual annotations, identifying words with positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. Additionally, SentiStrength-SE incorporates heuristics to address challenges such as negation detection, context-sensitive meanings, and the handling of informal language. The tool is evaluated using benchmark datasets, comparing its performance against existing domain-independent tools like NLTK and Stanford NLP. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SentiStrength-SE significantly outperforms these tools in accurately detecting sentiments in software engineering texts, highlighting the importance of domain specificity in sentiment analysis.
