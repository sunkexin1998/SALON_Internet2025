Sentiment expression in software engineering texts often includes technical jargon and domain-specific language, which can lead to misinterpretations by standard sentiment analysis tools. Additionally, emotions may be conveyed implicitly or through emojis, making it essential to customize sentiment analysis methods to capture these unique expressions effectively.

To effectively analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, it is crucial to customize sentiment analysis methods to accommodate the unique characteristics of the domain. This involves leveraging labeled software engineering-related texts to capture technical jargon and using large-scale emoji-labeled data from platforms like Twitter and GitHub to learn general sentiment patterns. The proposed SEntiMoji approach fine-tunes a pre-trained model (DeepMoji) with GitHub data to incorporate technical knowledge while utilizing emoji data to enhance sentiment representation. This dual approach helps improve the accuracy and reliability of sentiment analysis in software engineering contexts.
