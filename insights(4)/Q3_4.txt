Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial in software engineering sentiment analysis because technical texts often contain jargon and factual information, while sentiment expressive texts convey emotions and opinions. Accurate sentiment analysis requires recognizing these differences to avoid misinterpretation and improve classification accuracy.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering sentiment analysis, the paper suggests employing a preprocessing module that removes non-essential features, such as code snippets and URLs, which are common in technical texts. Additionally, it utilizes sentiment classification algorithms to identify subjective comments that express emotions or opinions. By focusing on specific linguistic cues, such as emoticons, negation words, and sentiment-laden vocabulary, the analysis can effectively classify comments into sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral) while filtering out purely technical descriptions that do not convey sentiment.
