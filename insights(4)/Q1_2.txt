To analyze sentiment in software engineering (SE) texts, the proposed approach, SESSION, utilizes a three-step process. First, it preprocesses and segments the SE text into clauses using natural language processing tools. Second, it applies filter rules based on sentence structures to identify clauses likely to express sentiment, ignoring those that do not fit specific patterns (e.g., subjunctive clauses). Third, it employs adjust rules to enhance sentiment scores derived from a dictionary-based tool, SentiStrength, by addressing issues like polysemous words and negations. This method improves sentiment analysis accuracy by recognizing the unique, indirect, and dispersed ways sentiments are expressed in SE texts, ultimately outperforming traditional sentiment analysis tools.
