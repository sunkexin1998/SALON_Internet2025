Sentiment expression in software engineering texts often involves domain-specific jargon that may not convey emotions as intended. Words like "error" or "support" can have neutral meanings in context, while emotional expressions may be subtle or context-dependent, complicating sentiment detection compared to general language.

To effectively analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, the paper suggests developing a domain-specific dictionary that captures the unique meanings of technical jargon. Additionally, incorporating heuristics to address context-sensitive variations, negations, and proper nouns is crucial. Preprocessing steps should filter out irrelevant content, such as code snippets and URLs, to minimize noise. The tool SentiStrength-SE, as described, leverages these strategies to improve sentiment detection accuracy by focusing on the specific linguistic characteristics and emotional expressions prevalent in software engineering communications. This tailored approach enhances the reliability of sentiment analysis in this technical domain.
