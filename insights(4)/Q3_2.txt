Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial in software engineering sentiment analysis because SE texts often express sentiments indirectly and dispersedly. This complexity requires tailored approaches to accurately identify sentiment, as traditional tools may misinterpret technical language as sentiment, leading to unreliable results.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering (SE) texts, the paper proposes a set of filter rules based on sentence structures. These rules identify patterns indicating sentiment expression, such as direct sentiment patterns (e.g., exclamations, emojis), decorated sentiment patterns (e.g., adverbs modifying sentiment words), and first-person expressions. Additionally, the approach filters out clauses that do not likely express sentiment, such as those in subjunctive mood or containing technical jargon. By applying these heuristics, the analysis can focus on relevant sentiment-expressive segments while ignoring purely technical descriptions.
