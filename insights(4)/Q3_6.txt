Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because technical jargon often conveys neutral or factual information, while sentiment expressive text reflects emotions. Misclassifying neutral technical content as negative can lead to inaccurate sentiment analysis, affecting insights into developers' emotions and communication dynamics.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering, the paper suggests leveraging a sentiment analysis classifier specifically trained on domain-specific content, such as Senti4SD. This classifier utilizes a combination of lexicon-based, keyword-based, and semantic features to accurately assess sentiment polarity. By analyzing the context in which technical terms are used, the classifier can differentiate between neutral descriptions and emotionally charged expressions. Additionally, employing a gold standard of annotated posts from platforms like Stack Overflow helps refine the model's ability to recognize sentiment in the unique language of software development.
