@christian-bromann I am interested in a code example for what you have said. Just curious here. Thanks"
As explained in #17  and in the previous comment there is a mistake in the PerfMetricSet class. The real data is the unit.I will close this issue because we can do nothing to fix it."
Done. Renamed "timestamp" to "freeze-date".  I'm actually setting "build-date" to the actual day that the image is built because it can differ from the freezedate.
Status.net groups were always a misguided misfeature.  Groups on status.net are just hashtags that you can follow... but properly implemented hashtags should be followable, making the extra syntax redundant and annoying.
I'd like to keep the YourKit stuff out of the oae module. You can deliver a custom setenv.sh.erb template via the setenv_template param to oae::app::server   If you add the YK java arguments to localconfig/templates/oae-setenv.sh.erb then the oae module w

We would like to be able to queue jobs to be run after a specific point in time. It will be helpful.
Can you rename `urls_or_config_hashes` to something less verbose? I think `nodes` is fine, as it is `#add_node` that is finally concerned with what to do with the contents.
Yes.  Good catch.  I'll add that documentation.
Are you using StofDoctrineExtensionsBundle ? it seems like the user object is not in identity map of unit of work of doctrine. It would be easier if it could be reproduced. which version of symfony and doctrine orm are you using?
I've tried plone.batching in my dev environment but it breaks the "standard_view" template from plone.app.collection because it uses the oldstyle CMFPlone batch_macros ... so this has to be changed there too, before merging thisone.
I believe this expression would be easier to understand:  ```lambda stack: any('CreatePairedMinidumps' in signature for signature in stack)```  it reduces to one level of parens and drops the confusing `find` and `-1`
so I think this is fine it works on master
It would be nice to have specs for these changes, and not just in the RSpec matchers!
@cristiandouce yes the example works correctly for me."
@fengyuanchen How can we send the cropped data to server side without using the ajaxUpload method?In my case I just removed the form tag and used a section element instead. This is because I'm using it within another form tag and don't want the form to submit. I'm working on a(n) update form and found your solution as the best feature I want."
@krystov How many sync folders do you have configured?"
We may want to call requestLayout() when setting the shadow layer as well.
I see your point and tend to agree. Names are but sound and smoke. I'll change it!
Well, whatever your goal is, if your run the code in a plain browser or in a sugar web activity, it is currently a different platform, for the meaning I'm giving to that word at least. The APIs you have access to are different and you somehow need to deal with that fact. That's all I meant :) Great to hear you will keep working on this.
Are multiple plots with the same range supported here too?
Replace L80-83 with        this.settingGroups.splice(         this.settingGroups.indexOf(this.defaultGroup), 1);
Hi Marie, We tried with three different browsers (Chrome, Firefox and Safari) on an iMac and each one produced an sequence output. Since "Zoom in" is the choice right above "Dump selection as FASTA", is it possible that you missed the selection? If not, please provide specific parameters so that we can better reproduce the problem. Thanks.

I thought I will implement it by myself, but currently I have no time for it. So I just write down the idea in case somebody will like it and implement, or in case I will return back to it next year. The idea is to extend the definition of variables so the strings could be used as the access-keys in addition to integer numbers. One can think of them as std::map<string,string>, or python dictionary, or lua tables which are the closest. Possibility to use dictionaries exists also in bash/zsh, though dictionaries are distinct from ordinary variables. Why it is useful? The latest example I saw is in __terlar_git_prompt, where you need to get a color and symbol for named elements in a list: for i in $fish_prompt_git_status_order    if contains $i in $gs      echo 'set_color $fish_color_git_'$i      echo 'echo -n $fish_prompt_git_status_'$i    endend | .Where $i runs the items from the list: added modified deleted etc.If one could use variables as dictionaries this piece of code could be rewritten in the following way:for i in $fish_prompt_git_status_order    if contains $i in $gs      set_color $fish_color_git[$i]      echo -n $fish_prompt_git_status[$i]    endendWhich for me looks much nicer and simpler.How not to break the ordinary variables?That is actually very simple. The idea is almost the same as in lua tables (http://lua-users.org/wiki/TablesTutorial):If the key is number it refers to the 'array' part of the variable which is what a variables currently.If the key is a string (starts from a letter for example) it refers to the dictionary part.Dictionary part should not affect all the previous behaviour. "$variable" is expanded to a list of array part. 'count $variable' will print the number of elements in the array part."set var " also works only with the array part.The differences comes with handling subscription:'set var[key] value' or 'set var[key1 key2] value1 value2' should be expanded to handle string keys.$var[key] or $var[$key] or $var[key1 key2] should return values which were previously set.There should also be functions for working with dictionaries like getting list of keys for iteration or getting the number of elements in dictionary part.set var[a b c] d e fecho $var  #-><nothing>count $var #->0get --size var   #-> 3get --keys var   #-> a b c get --values var #-> d e fget --pairs var  #-> a d b e c fOther issuesOne should also update universal variables handling.Dictionary part of the variables could not be exported.Thats itAny ideas/thoughts/critics are appreciated."
@pmjones Yes @phpdocumentor was complaining . I discusses with @mvreil and he mentioned to add `\StdClass` as param
I stumbled on this behaviour a few days ago when mass importing stuff into Nikola. Looks like my example wasn't that great. My test was made with this rev: ralsina/nikola@df26537I updated to the latest version from github (master) now.I tried again with setting up the demo site and then going through my steps descriped above.To make it clearly different from the first post I did not only change the date but also the url title and tags aswell removed the source before buildingWhen running doit I am not seeing the build of a new archive (overview) page. Neither is a new tag overview generated."
Actually the indentation is not possible here because I used some white spaces to indent the XSLT output. This is a general XLST file to convert a docBook structure in reStructuredText format. I used the XSLT syntax + the special template php:function() u
I like it. :ok_hand:
Analysis: The pattern match failure is no big deal, but it cannot be fixed until the second issue is fixed. The second issue is a bit more serious. The ILAst after the last ILAst transform is as follows: finally {     stloc:IDisposable(var_2_2F, isinst:IDisposable([mscorlib]System.IDisposable, ldloc:IEnumerator(var_1)))     if (logicnot(ldloc:IDisposable[exp:bool](var_2_2F))) {         endfinally()     } else {     }      callvirt:void(IDisposable::Dispose, ldloc:IDisposable(var_2_2F))     endfinally() }  That code is technically correct, but it cannot easily be transformed into a C# AST without introducing an unnecessary goto, since C# provides no mechanism for leaving a finally block other than by falling through the bottom. I tested some other code, and have found that pretty much every case involving more than one endfinally in a finally block can cause similar problems. I have further checked the code, and endfinally is simply dropped on conversion to the C# AST, which is only valid if it is the last statement in the finally block. With that in mind, the best fix that I can see is to create a special basic block consisting of only a label and an endfinally(), and replace the endfinally() calls in other basic blocks with a branch to this block. (Do not forget that endfinally() can take arguments with side effects which may need to become stand-alone expressions). The new endfinally basic block cannot be incorporated into a loop or conditional structure, and must be the very last basic block merged into the flattened block. This is to ensure that it will be the last instruction in the finally block so that the C# code has execution just fall out the bottom of the finally block. The above would not need to be done with any finally block that does not contain an endfinally, which is permissible if it always either does not terminate or throws an exception. (All of this would also apply to fault blocks.)
I really like how you have refactored this method!
This IS a MessagSource, so yes RedisStoreMessageSource is the right name. The SPCA is the adapter, delegating to a source.  The AmqpInboundChannelAdapter is different. It's an active component (not polled) that extends MessageProducerSupport so it has the

It tries to set item name and that doesn't exist there.

Good catch. This is probably spammy and race-prone.
I still seem to get these all the time.
I think I found my mistake. The problem is that when you use the multiscan dialog of Paperwork, it always force the source to the first value that matches what looks like an ADF. I will fix that asap

Just create a linear dungeon where user and enemies walk through each other.
Could not load an SSH config at work today. Something is wrong with the param parsing.
I tend to use `foo.must_be :blank?` for stuff like this. MiniTest::Spec will take any symbol with a `?` at the end and call that method on it and use the symbol for pretty error messages. So good things like `:valid?`, `:present?`, etc are all possible.

Well, currently making a zip for Cydia is a no-brainer.  We basically just use the entire repo.  What I'm thinking we'll need to do instead is to create separate repos for each theme.  The icons repo will have iPad, iPhone and source icon images.  Then we'll have to have a build script that will compile only the iPad icons into the iPad theme and the iPhone icons into the iPhone theme. If we decide to go the iPad route @dreamnetSome GUI them subfoldersome-iphone-gui-control.pngthe-same-gui-control-but-the-ipad-version.pnginfo.iphone.plistinfo.ipad.plistThen we have the build script rename the plist files depending on which Glasklart theme we're building.  So in BOTH themes both the iPhone and iPad items would be in there but in the iPad version it would have the iPad plists and vice versa."
Make link to hasatypo.org actually 'hasatypo.org' and not the shortened link in the tweet
It is usefull for raw cell, where you can start on `diff --git`. End, I'm not sure.
Instead of using 'h', perhaps we should use constants? Imho that would make the code more legible.
Add a "Climate" category? To include "climate change". Not a policy area listed in Natura 2000 but seems like a key area and is mention in MMO list of evidence areas.

the status displays branch name followed by remote, while the git command follows remote/branch name. It would be more consistent to also follow this. "
Hi Mark, I have this week more time, will respond to your thread.
Yes, directly to master would do right now. Thanks very much @decanus"
