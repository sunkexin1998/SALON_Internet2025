The following code therefore, might be ( as I have not attempted using it ) a better one, if you are willing to use Mojarra specific classes.
As an aside, configuring the CODE_FRAGMENT that is created by the CODE_FRAGMENT is not supported.
You can use this regex.
Any help would be appreciated.
And my Gradle File looks like this.
