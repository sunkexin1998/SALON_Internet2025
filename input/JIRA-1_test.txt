Sorry about that.
The patch looks good.
I'm sorry.
But now that I think about it, it may crap out when coming back to read even on a recovered file.
The defect  from hell 666, be scared..
It's not too bad once CacheConfig is in.
Taking it over Thanks,Mayank
This looks good to me.
Finally closing this bug from hell.
You're results are awesome Paul. Great work :) Looking forward to see your new JSON parser in trunk whenever you think is ready."
Sorry, my code base is a little old, looks alike HADOOP - 9147 add some new test in TestFileStatus.
Sorry about that.
huh ... i thought i did resolve this.
damn this was assigned to you since months.
This is bad.
I haven't had any time to try re-upgrading after having to back out 2.0.8, but I will be sure to let you know how it works out as soon as I get the opportunity.
Yes it is a dup, thanks Mike for taking care of this (I planned to do this yesterday but didn't make it)
Sorry I didn't use your patch, but I think you' ll alike the end result.
It also happens at the very startup after he has loaded only 3 sstables( hence DataTracker likely have 3 sstables, not a shit load).
But please don't say that my reasoning is bad - because it is not.
Brain fart.
Sweet, I will review and apply.
Great! It's been good to be able to contribute and I hope to be able to more for this awesome project when I have the spare time.
Sorry to have not spotted this one, and thanks for your care.
Please forget last comment, it is incorrect.
Weird.
HTML is quite uncomfortable to work with.
Applied patch with thanks to Scott.
If you know of a way, please describe it.
Sorry about that.
tricky shit man! I think I found the issue!
This really sucks!
Sorry I missed the "overwrite" keyword.
Forget the patch for the moment."
Sorry, for all the issue mails, I forgot to mention the second:2) There is commented source in the test, should it be enabled or removed?
Damn...
Sorry if this spam's things, however it's unlikely that I' ll work on these.
sorry for your time.
Hi Carlos, This looks awesome! Lots of cool stuff.
sorry, this bug is *not* fixed.
This way lies metadata hell.
sorry about this.
Oops, had a bad comparator in the TestCLI config.
Ok. Stupid user Error here.
Daryn, the current patch looks good.
Great work...this is awesome stuff.
Thank you,+ Harit Himanshu
Too bad we can't use position:fixed in IE6.
When you install a node module globally it goes into /usr/local where you don't have permissions to move shit into unless you sudo.
Thanks to Edward and Brock for the reviews.
I'm an idiot.
Awesome! This tool is cool.
I missed the context.
This is only a problem with exceptions from java.
This looks simple and sweet to me.
My bad.
It will be great if you could confirm it either way first.
Thanks for moving so quickly on this guys.
My bad.
This was a very bad bug, introduced by me being an idiot.
You are messing down deep below hbase in dfs.
which is silly -- bad package encapsulation).
That sounds alike some serious buck passing.
Sorry, I guess I'm against ""never computing this shit""... because you guys think returning NaN is ok.
I lost the whole morning cause HBase's RegionServer was dying with no logs, no nothing... how Am I supposed to debug the issue if u do not even generate a core dump?
I've looked at what can be done within the NSIS framework we use to build the Windows installer.
Forgot to mention: Thanks to Alejandro and his team for pointing this one...
I don't care if everything is pretty or not, but we should at least support basic admin functionality in IE IMO (though I have not used it for years for just about anything).
@Ashutosh: thanks a lot for the comments.
Hello George,The fix looks fine, many thanks!
Thanks Tony.
No sorry.
great. awesome job sergey!
This sucks.
(How bad is this?
Here are 2 patches ... one for adjustExamplePaths.bat & .sh and the other a new file holding 2 User Libraries ... UIMA_LIB & UIMA_AS_LIB.Not sure where this should go ..."
Thanks Alexei, the patch is fine.
Marcelo, thanks for pointing out this; it is now fixed in rev.
Sorry for the super-slow uptake on this, the new job is using up all of my limited brain resources.
Here is quite bad.
who the fuck is asking for scores, but not the max score, and why does their insanely specialized use case justify all these booleans on a central lucene class.
Thanks, Tom
Because, we don't care for this in cases where we there is no node that is down.
Thanks Ravi.
I'm happy to use it as the standard logo (i.e. website, etc.).
A feature with wrong functionality is as bad as, if not worse than, a bad performance.
Thanks Koji!
I'm a pretty strong -0 on this.
Oh, sorry.
Thanks Sandy.
Thank you Brandon.
Sorry for the confusion :)
I have a really bad habit of not reading thru all the bug comments before asking questions.
