To analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, particularly code review comments, a customized sentiment analysis tool like SentiCR is recommended. The process involves several key steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of code review comments from open-source projects, ensuring to exclude automated bot comments.
2. **Manual Labeling**: Manually label the comments as positive, negative, or neutral to create a sentiment oracle.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Implement preprocessing techniques such as expanding contractions, removing URLs, handling emoticons, and negation processing to accurately capture sentiment context.
4. **Feature Extraction**: Generate feature vectors using methods like TF-IDF while filtering out irrelevant words.
5. **Model Training**: Use supervised learning algorithms (e.g., Gradient Boosting Tree) to train the model on the labeled dataset.
6. **Evaluation**: Validate the model's performance through cross-validation and adjust based on precision, recall, and accuracy metrics.
This tailored approach addresses the unique characteristics of software engineering communication.
