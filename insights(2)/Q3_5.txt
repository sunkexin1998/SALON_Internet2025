Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial in software engineering sentiment analysis because technical jargon can obscure sentiment meaning, leading to misclassifications. Accurate sentiment detection requires understanding both the emotional context and the specific technical language used by developers in their communications.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering sentiment analysis, the paper suggests leveraging a combination of labeled sentiment data and emoji usage. Technical texts, such as commit messages or issue comments, often contain jargon that may not convey sentiment directly. By analyzing posts from platforms like GitHub and Twitter, which include emotional emojis, the approach captures both the technical context and general sentiment patterns. This dual analysis allows for the identification of sentiment within technical discussions, improving the accuracy of sentiment classification by integrating emotional cues alongside technical language.
