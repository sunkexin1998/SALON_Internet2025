In software engineering texts, sentiment expression differs from general domains due to the presence of code snippets, specific terminologies, and emojis. Developers often express positive sentiments towards individuals (e.g., gratitude) and negative sentiments towards projects (e.g., frustration), reflecting their collaborative and technical context.

To analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, the paper suggests several preprocessing steps: removing non-English characters, expanding contractions, and eliminating code snippets, URLs, and quotations. It also emphasizes stop words removal and processing emoticons to capture sentiment effectively. Additionally, negation handling is crucial, as it alters sentiment meaning. The authors recommend using feature vectorization methods like TF-IDF and Doc2Vec to represent the text, followed by supervised machine learning classifiers for sentiment classification. This tailored approach addresses the unique characteristics of software engineering communication, enhancing the accuracy of sentiment analysis.
