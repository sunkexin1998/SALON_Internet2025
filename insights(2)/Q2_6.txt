The paper highlights that sentiment expression in software engineering texts often includes technical jargon and problem descriptions, leading to misclassifications by general sentiment analysis tools. Neutral technical texts are frequently misclassified as negative due to the presence of negative lexicon, reflecting the unique context of developer communication.

To effectively analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, the paper suggests using a specialized classifier like Senti4SD, which is trained on domain-specific data from platforms like Stack Overflow. This classifier incorporates lexicon-based, keyword-based, and semantic features to accurately capture sentiment. It addresses the negative bias of off-the-shelf tools by reducing misclassifications of neutral texts as negative. Additionally, employing word embedding techniques helps understand the contextual meaning of terms, allowing for a more nuanced sentiment analysis that considers the unique language and expressions used by developers in their communications.
