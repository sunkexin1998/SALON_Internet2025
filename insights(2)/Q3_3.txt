Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial in software engineering sentiment analysis because technical texts often contain jargon and code snippets that do not convey sentiment. Accurate sentiment analysis requires focusing on expressive language to avoid misinterpretation and ensure relevant insights into developer emotions and feedback.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering, the paper suggests several preprocessing steps. These include removing code snippets and programming keywords that do not express sentiment, expanding contractions, and handling emoticons to capture their sentiment polarity. Additionally, negation preprocessing is employed to accurately identify the scope of negation in sentences, ensuring that sentiment is correctly interpreted. By focusing on expressive language and filtering out technical jargon, the analysis can more effectively identify sentiments in code review comments, leading to more accurate sentiment classification.
