Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial in software engineering sentiment analysis because technical texts often contain jargon and factual information, while sentiment expressive texts convey emotions and opinions. Accurate sentiment analysis requires recognizing this difference to avoid misinterpretation and enhance the relevance of the analysis.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering sentiment analysis, the paper suggests employing preprocessing techniques that focus on identifying subjective language. This includes removing code snippets, URLs, and non-English characters, while also recognizing emoticons and negation words. The analysis classifies comments into categories based on sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and identifies entities (Person or Project). By applying these methods, the system can effectively filter out objective technical descriptions and focus on comments that express emotions or opinions, thus improving the accuracy of sentiment classification.
