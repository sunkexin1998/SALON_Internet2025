To analyze sentiment in software engineering (SE) texts, the proposed approach, SESSION, utilizes a three-step process. First, it preprocesses and segments the SE text into clauses using natural language processing tools. Second, it applies filter rules based on sentence structures to identify clauses likely to express sentiment, ignoring those that do not fit specific patterns (e.g., subjunctive clauses). Third, it employs adjustment rules to enhance sentiment scores derived from the SentiStrength dictionary-based tool, addressing issues like polysemous words and negations. This method improves sentiment analysis by recognizing the unique, indirect, and dispersed ways sentiments are expressed in SE texts, leading to better accuracy and generalizability compared to traditional sentiment analysis tools. The approach has been empirically validated across multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing developers' sentiments in various SE contexts.
