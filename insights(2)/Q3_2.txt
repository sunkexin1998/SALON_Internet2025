Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial in software engineering sentiment analysis because SE texts often express sentiments indirectly and dispersedly. This differentiation helps accurately identify sentiment-bearing clauses, improving the reliability of sentiment analysis tools that may misinterpret technical language as sentiment.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering (SE) texts, the paper proposes specific filter rules based on sentence structures. These rules identify patterns indicating sentiment expression, such as direct sentiment patterns (e.g., exclamation marks, emojis), decorated sentiment patterns (e.g., adverbs modifying sentiment words), and first-person expressions. Additionally, the approach filters out clauses that do not match these patterns, focusing on those likely to express sentiments. By applying these heuristics, the analysis can effectively isolate sentiment-bearing clauses from purely technical descriptions, enhancing the accuracy of sentiment detection in SE texts.
