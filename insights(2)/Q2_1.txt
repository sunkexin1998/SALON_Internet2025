Sentiment expression in software engineering texts often involves domain-specific terminology, where words like "error" or "support" may carry neutral meanings rather than their typical positive or negative connotations. Additionally, context-sensitive variations and technical jargon can mislead sentiment analysis tools, leading to inaccuracies in sentiment detection.

To effectively analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, the paper suggests developing a domain-specific dictionary that captures the unique meanings of technical terms. Additionally, incorporating heuristics to address context-sensitive variations, negation handling, and proper noun identification is crucial. Preprocessing steps should filter out irrelevant content, such as code snippets and URLs, to minimize noise. The tool SentiStrength-SE, as described in the paper, integrates these strategies to improve sentiment detection accuracy, demonstrating that domain-specific techniques significantly outperform general sentiment analysis tools in the software engineering context.
