Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment-expressive text is crucial in software engineering sentiment analysis because SE texts often express sentiments indirectly and dispersedly. Recognizing this difference allows for more accurate sentiment detection by filtering out neutral or technical clauses that do not convey emotional content.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment-expressive text in software engineering (SE) texts, the proposed approach utilizes specific filter rules based on sentence structures. It identifies patterns indicating sentiment, such as direct sentiment expressions (e.g., exclamations, emojis), decorated sentiment patterns (adverbs modifying sentiment words), and first-person expressions. Sentences that do not match these patterns are filtered out. Additionally, the approach recognizes subjunctive clauses and polysemous words to avoid misclassifying neutral or technical content as sentimental, ensuring that only relevant clauses contributing to sentiment analysis are considered.
