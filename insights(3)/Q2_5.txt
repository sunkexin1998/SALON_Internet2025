Sentiment expression in software engineering texts often involves technical jargon and domain-specific language, which can lead to misunderstandings by standard sentiment analysis tools. Additionally, emotions may be conveyed implicitly or through specific phrases, making it challenging to accurately classify sentiments compared to general texts.

To effectively analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, the paper suggests customizing sentiment analysis tools to incorporate domain-specific knowledge. This can be achieved by leveraging labeled software engineering-related texts to train sentiment classifiers. Additionally, the use of emoji-labeled data from social media and developer platforms like GitHub can help capture both technical jargon and general sentiment patterns. The proposed SEntiMoji approach fine-tunes a pre-trained model (DeepMoji) using this emoji data, allowing it to better understand the nuances of sentiment expression in software engineering contexts, ultimately improving classification accuracy.
