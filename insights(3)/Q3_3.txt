Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial in software engineering sentiment analysis because technical texts often contain jargon and code snippets that do not convey sentiment. Accurate sentiment analysis requires focusing on expressive language to avoid misinterpretation and ensure relevant insights into developer sentiments.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering, the paper suggests several preprocessing steps. These include removing code snippets and programming keywords that do not express sentiment, expanding contractions, and handling emoticons to reflect their sentiment polarity. Additionally, the authors implement negation preprocessing to accurately capture the sentiment context of phrases. By filtering out non-sentiment-related content and focusing on expressive language, the analysis can more effectively identify and interpret the sentiments conveyed in code review comments, leading to more accurate sentiment classification.
