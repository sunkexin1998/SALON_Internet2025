Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial in software engineering sentiment analysis because technical jargon can obscure sentiment meanings, leading to misclassifications. Understanding the context and emotional expressions helps improve the accuracy of sentiment detection, ensuring relevant insights for developers and project managers.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering sentiment analysis, the paper suggests leveraging emoji usage as indicators of sentiment. Emojis can serve as noisy labels that help identify emotional expressions within texts. By analyzing posts from platforms like GitHub and Twitter, which contain both technical content and emotional cues, the approach captures the context of technical jargon while recognizing sentiment patterns. This dual analysis allows for the effective separation of technical descriptions from sentiment expressions, enhancing the accuracy of sentiment classification in software engineering texts.
