To analyze sentiment in software engineering (SE) texts, the proposed SEntiMoji approach leverages emoji usage as noisy sentiment labels. It combines data from both social media (like Twitter) and technical platforms (like GitHub) to capture general sentiment patterns and technical jargon. The process involves two main stages: first, fine-tuning a pre-trained representation model (DeepMoji) using emoji-labeled texts from GitHub to incorporate domain-specific knowledge; second, using this fine-tuned model to generate sentiment-aware vector representations of labeled SE texts, which are then used to train a sentiment classifier. This method effectively addresses the limitations of traditional sentiment analysis tools that struggle with technical language, achieving improved accuracy and performance on SE-related datasets by integrating insights from both technical and general domains.
