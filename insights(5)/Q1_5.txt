To analyze sentiment in software engineering (SE) texts, the proposed SEntiMoji approach leverages emoji usage as noisy sentiment labels. It combines data from both social media (e.g., Twitter) and technical platforms (e.g., GitHub) to capture general sentiment patterns and domain-specific jargon. The process involves two main stages: first, fine-tuning a pre-trained representation model (DeepMoji) using emoji-labeled texts from GitHub to incorporate technical knowledge; second, using this fine-tuned model to generate sentiment-aware vector representations of labeled SE texts, which are then used to train a sentiment classifier. This method significantly improves sentiment analysis performance in SE by effectively utilizing both general and technical sentiment expressions, addressing the limitations of traditional sentiment analysis tools that struggle with technical jargon.
