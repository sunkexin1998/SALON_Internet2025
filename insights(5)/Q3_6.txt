Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because technical jargon often leads to misclassifications in sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis tools, typically trained on general language, may misinterpret neutral technical descriptions as negative, skewing results and affecting the understanding of developers' emotions in software engineering contexts.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering, the paper suggests employing a sentiment analysis classifier specifically trained on domain-specific content, such as Senti4SD. This classifier utilizes a combination of lexicon-based, keyword-based, and semantic features tailored to the software engineering context. By leveraging a gold standard of annotated posts from platforms like Stack Overflow, the classifier can accurately identify sentiment polarity while accounting for the unique use of technical jargon. This approach helps mitigate misclassifications of neutral technical descriptions as negative, enhancing the understanding of developers' emotions in their communications.
