The paper highlights that sentiment expression in software engineering texts often includes technical jargon and problem descriptions, leading to misclassifications by general sentiment analysis tools. Neutral technical texts are frequently misclassified as negative due to the presence of negative lexicon, complicating accurate sentiment detection in this domain.

To effectively analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, the paper proposes using a specialized classifier, Senti4SD, which is trained on domain-specific data from Stack Overflow. This classifier incorporates lexicon-based, keyword-based, and semantic features to accurately capture sentiment. By leveraging a gold standard of annotated posts, Senti4SD addresses the negative bias of off-the-shelf tools, reducing misclassifications of neutral texts as negative. The use of word embedding techniques further enhances understanding of contextual meanings, allowing for more accurate sentiment detection tailored to the unique language and expressions found in software engineering communications.
