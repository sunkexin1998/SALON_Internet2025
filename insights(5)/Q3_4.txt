Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial in software engineering sentiment analysis because technical texts often contain jargon and factual information, while sentiment expressive texts convey emotions and opinions. Accurate sentiment analysis requires recognizing these differences to avoid misinterpretation and improve classification accuracy.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering sentiment analysis, the paper suggests employing a preprocessing module that identifies and removes non-sentimental elements, such as code snippets, URLs, and technical jargon. Sentiment expressive texts are typically subjective and contain emotional cues, which can be detected through specific linguistic features, such as emoticons, negation words, and sentiment-laden vocabulary. The classification module then categorizes comments into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, while the entity recognition module identifies the subjects of these sentiments, ensuring a clear separation between technical descriptions and emotional expressions.
