Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial in software engineering sentiment analysis because technical jargon can obscure sentiment meanings, leading to misclassifications. Accurate sentiment detection requires understanding both the emotional context and the specific technical language used by developers in their communications.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering sentiment analysis, the approach involves leveraging both labeled sentiment data and emoji usage. Technical jargon is identified through posts from platforms like GitHub, which provide context-specific language. In contrast, sentiment expressive text is captured from broader social media sources like Twitter, where emojis serve as indicators of sentiment. By combining these sources, the model can learn sentiment-aware representations that account for both the emotional context and the technical language, improving the accuracy of sentiment classification in software engineering texts.
