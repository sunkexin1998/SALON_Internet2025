To analyze sentiment in software engineering (SE) texts, the proposed approach, SESSION, employs a three-step methodology. First, it preprocesses and segments the SE text into clauses using natural language processing tools. Second, it applies filter rules based on specific sentence structures to identify clauses likely to express sentiment, ignoring those that do not fit predefined patterns. These patterns include direct sentiment expressions, decorated sentiments with adverbs, and judgmental phrases. Finally, it enhances sentiment analysis results using adjustment rules that account for nuances in SE texts, such as recognizing subjunctive moods and handling polysemous words. This approach improves upon traditional dictionary-based tools by focusing on the unique ways sentiments are expressed in SE contexts, leading to more accurate sentiment classification.
