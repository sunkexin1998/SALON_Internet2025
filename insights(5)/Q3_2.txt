Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment-expressive text is crucial in software engineering sentiment analysis because SE texts often express sentiments indirectly and dispersedly. This complexity requires tailored approaches to accurately identify sentiment, as traditional tools may misinterpret technical language as sentiment, leading to unreliable results.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment-expressive text in software engineering (SE) texts, the proposed approach utilizes specific filter rules based on sentence structures. These rules identify patterns indicating sentiment, such as direct sentiment expressions (e.g., exclamations, emojis), decorated sentiment (adverbs modifying sentiment words), and first-person expressions. Additionally, the approach filters out clauses that do not likely express sentiment, such as those in subjunctive mood or containing technical jargon. By applying these heuristics, the method effectively isolates sentiment-expressive segments from technical descriptions, enhancing the accuracy of sentiment analysis in SE contexts.
