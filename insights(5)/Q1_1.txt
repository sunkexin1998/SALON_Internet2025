To analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, the paper introduces SentiStrength-SE, a domain-specific sentiment analysis tool. The process involves creating a tailored domain dictionary that captures the unique emotional expressions and technical jargon used in software engineering. This dictionary is developed through qualitative studies and manual annotations, identifying words with positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. Additionally, SentiStrength-SE incorporates heuristics to address challenges such as negation detection, context-sensitive meanings, and the handling of technical terms. The tool is evaluated using benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to general-purpose sentiment analysis tools like NLTK and Stanford NLP. The combination of a specialized dictionary and heuristics allows for more accurate sentiment detection in software engineering texts, facilitating better understanding of developer emotions and their impact on collaboration and productivity.
