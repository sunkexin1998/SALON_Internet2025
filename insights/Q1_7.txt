To analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, researchers should utilize SE-specific sentiment analysis tools rather than general-purpose ones, as the latter often yield unreliable results due to their training on non-technical domains. The process involves selecting appropriate tools that have been fine-tuned for the software engineering context, such as SentiStrength-SE, DEV A, Senti4SD, and SentiCR. It is crucial to perform a preliminary sanity check to ensure the tool aligns with the research goals and conceptualization of affect. Additionally, researchers should consider the unit of analysis (e.g., individual comments vs. discussions) as it can significantly impact sentiment classification. If retraining tools is not feasible, employing an ensemble approach with multiple tools and majority voting can enhance accuracy. Finally, manual annotation of a subset of texts can serve as a gold standard for validating tool performance and addressing discrepancies in sentiment classification.
