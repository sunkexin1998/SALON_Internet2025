Sentiment expression in software engineering texts is often indirect and dispersed, as developers typically describe issues before expressing sentiments. This leads to challenges like misclassifying neutral technical terms as negative and dealing with complex sentence structures that may not convey sentiment directly.

To effectively analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, the paper suggests incorporating pre-trained transformer models, specifically RoBERTa, into a deep learning framework like TextCNN. This approach captures the unique sentiment expressions by leveraging contextual embeddings and employing a convolutional neural network to explore semantic features. Additionally, introducing residual connections between RoBERTa and TextCNN enhances cooperation during training. This integrated framework aims to improve both accuracy and generalizability across different datasets, addressing challenges such as misclassification of neutral terms and complex sentence structures that may obscure sentiment.
