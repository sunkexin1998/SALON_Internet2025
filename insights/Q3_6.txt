Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because technical jargon often leads to misclassifications in sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis tools, typically trained on general language, may misinterpret neutral technical content as negative, affecting the accuracy of sentiment detection in software engineering contexts.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering, the paper suggests leveraging a specialized sentiment analysis classifier, Senti4SD, which is trained on domain-specific data. This classifier utilizes a combination of lexicon-based, keyword-based, and semantic features tailored to the software engineering context. By analyzing the context in which words are used, Senti4SD can accurately identify sentiment polarity, reducing misclassifications of neutral technical content as negative. Additionally, employing a gold standard of annotated posts from platforms like Stack Overflow helps refine the classifier's ability to discern between technical descriptions and emotionally charged expressions.
