Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial in software engineering sentiment analysis because technical texts often contain neutral or negative terms that do not reflect sentiment. Misclassifying these terms can lead to inaccurate sentiment assessments, undermining the analysis of developers' true attitudes and emotions.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering sentiment analysis, the paper suggests focusing on the context in which terms are used. This involves identifying phrases that explicitly express sentiment, such as positive or negative qualifiers, and recognizing the structure of sentences. Techniques like heuristic-based approaches can help filter out neutral technical terms that may be misclassified as negative. Additionally, incorporating pre-trained models like RoBERTa can enhance the model's ability to capture nuanced sentiment expressions, allowing for better differentiation between technical descriptions and genuine sentiment expressions in the text.
