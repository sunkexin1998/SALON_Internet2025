To analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, researchers should utilize SE-specific sentiment analysis tools tailored for the domain. The study highlights the importance of using lexicon-based approaches, such as SentiStrength-SE and DEVA, which perform better in cross-platform settings compared to supervised tools when retraining is not feasible. For effective sentiment analysis, it is crucial to build a robust gold standard dataset, ensuring high inter-rater agreement and consistent annotation guidelines based on theoretical emotion models. Additionally, platform-specific tuning is recommended, as sentiment expressions can vary across different collaborative environments (e.g., GitHub, Jira, Stack Overflow). Researchers should also conduct preliminary sanity checks on sample data to verify the alignment between tool outputs and manual labels, ensuring the reliability of sentiment classification in software engineering contexts.
