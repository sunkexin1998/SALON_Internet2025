To analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, particularly in pull request discussions, a systematic approach is recommended. First, create a curated dataset, such as PRemo, which includes manually labeled messages from various software projects. Utilize a robust emotion model, like Shaver's model, to guide the labeling process, ensuring that messages are classified into positive, negative, or neutral categories. Employ multiple experts from diverse fields (e.g., software engineering and neuroscience) to minimize subjectivity and enhance reliability. After labeling, assess the performance of sentiment analysis tools using metrics like precision, recall, and F-score. Analyze the tools' effectiveness in classifying different sentiment types, paying special attention to the challenges posed by subtle or mixed sentiments. Finally, consider the influence of expert agreement on tool performance, as disagreements may indicate more complex sentiment characteristics that require further investigation.
