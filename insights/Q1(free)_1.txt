To analyze sentiment for software engineering texts, the paper introduces a tool called **SentiStrength-SE**, which is specifically designed to address the unique challenges of sentiment analysis in the software engineering domain. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key steps and methodologies outlined in the paper for conducting sentiment analysis in this context:
### 1. **Understanding the Challenges**
   - **Domain-Specific Language**: Software engineering texts often contain technical jargon that may not carry the same sentiment as in general language. For example, words like "error" or "support" may have negative or positive connotations in a technical context but are neutral in software engineering.
   - **Context Sensitivity**: The meaning of words can change based on context. For instance, "like" can express sentiment in one context but be neutral in another.
   - **Negation Handling**: The presence of negation words can invert the sentiment of the words that follow them, which is crucial for accurate sentiment detection.
   - **Missing Sentimental Words**: Many emotionally charged words may not be included in existing sentiment dictionaries, leading to missed sentiments.
### 2. **Creating a Domain-Specific Dictionary**
   - **Domain Dictionary Development**: A domain-specific dictionary is created by analyzing a large dataset of software engineering texts (e.g., commit messages, JIRA comments). This dictionary includes words and phrases that are relevant to the software engineering context, along with their associated sentiment scores.
   - **Human Annotation**: Human raters with software engineering experience are involved in identifying which words are neutral and which carry sentiment in the software engineering context.
### 3. **Incorporating Heuristics**
   - **Contextual Heuristics**: Heuristics are developed to handle specific challenges, such as identifying the context in which certain words are used, recognizing negations, and filtering out irrelevant content (e.g., code snippets, URLs).
   - **Preprocessing**: A preprocessing phase is included to clean the text data by removing non-sentimental content and correcting spelling errors.
### 4. **Sentiment Detection Process**
   - **Lexical Approach**: The tool uses a lexicon-based approach, where each word in the text is checked against the domain-specific dictionary to determine its sentiment score.
   - **Score Calculation**: For each piece of text, a pair of scores is calculated representing positive and negative sentiments. The overall sentiment is determined based on these scores.
   - **Evaluation Metrics**: The performance of the sentiment analysis is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F-score, comparing the results against a benchmark dataset with manually annotated sentiments.
### 5. **Empirical Evaluation**
   - **Benchmark Dataset**: The tool is evaluated using a benchmark dataset consisting of software engineering texts that have been manually annotated for sentiment.
   - **Comparative Analysis**: SentiStrength-SE is compared against other existing sentiment analysis tools (e.g., SentiStrength, NLTK, Stanford NLP) to demonstrate its effectiveness in the software engineering domain.
### 6. **Iterative Improvement**
   - **Feedback Loop**: The tool is continuously improved based on qualitative evaluations and feedback from the analysis of misclassified sentiments, allowing for the refinement of the dictionary and heuristics.
### Conclusion
By leveraging a domain-specific dictionary and tailored heuristics, SentiStrength-SE effectively addresses the unique challenges of sentiment analysis in software engineering texts. This approach allows for more accurate sentiment detection, which can be beneficial for understanding developer emotions and improving collaboration and productivity in software development environments.
