In the context of sentiment analysis for software engineering texts, it is important to distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text for several reasons:
1. **Nature of Content**: Technical descriptive text typically contains factual information, specifications, or instructions related to software development, such as code snippets, bug descriptions, or feature requests. In contrast, sentiment expressive text conveys emotions, opinions, or attitudes of developers towards specific entities (e.g., other developers, projects, or tools). Mixing these two types of text can lead to inaccurate sentiment analysis results.
2. **Sentiment Relevance**: Sentiment analysis aims to capture the emotional tone of comments or discussions. Technical descriptions may not express any sentiment at all, while sentiment expressive text is specifically designed to convey feelings or opinions. Analyzing both types of text together could dilute the sentiment signals and lead to misleading conclusions about the overall sentiment in a software engineering context.
3. **Different Processing Requirements**: The processing techniques for technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text may differ significantly. Technical text may require more focus on syntax, terminology, and structure, while sentiment expressive text may benefit from techniques that capture emotional cues, such as sentiment lexicons or emotion detection algorithms. By distinguishing between the two, analysts can apply the most appropriate methods for each type of text.
4. **Contextual Understanding**: Understanding the context in which sentiment is expressed is crucial for accurate analysis. For example, a comment that appears neutral in a technical context may carry a negative sentiment when viewed in the context of a developer's frustration with a project. By separating technical and sentiment expressive texts, analysts can better interpret the sentiment in relation to the specific context of software development.
5. **Improved Accuracy**: By focusing on sentiment expressive text, tools like SentiSW can achieve higher accuracy in sentiment classification and entity recognition. The paper highlights that existing sentiment analysis tools often perform poorly in software engineering due to the lack of domain-specific information. By isolating sentiment expressive text, the analysis can be more targeted and effective.
In summary, distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is essential for accurate sentiment analysis in software engineering, as it allows for more relevant processing, better contextual understanding, and improved overall accuracy in capturing developers' sentiments.

The paper outlines several strategies to distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text when analyzing sentiment in software engineering contexts. Here are the key approaches mentioned:
1. **Text Classification**: The first step involves classifying the text into different categories based on its content. The authors propose using a sentiment classification tool (like SentiSW) that can categorize comments into three classes: positive, negative, or neutral. This classification helps identify which comments express sentiment and which are purely technical.
2. **Sentiment Indicators**: The analysis can focus on specific linguistic features or indicators that are commonly associated with sentiment. For example, the presence of emotive language, subjective phrases, or certain keywords (like "thank," "sorry," or "disappointed") can signal that a comment is sentiment expressive rather than technical. The tool can be designed to recognize these indicators.
3. **Negation Handling**: The paper discusses the importance of recognizing negation in sentiment expressive text. Sentences that contain negation words (e.g., "not," "no") can change the sentiment of the statement. By identifying and processing these negations, the analysis can better capture the sentiment expressed in the text.
4. **Entity Recognition**: The authors emphasize the need to recognize entities within the text, such as "Person" or "Project." Sentiment expressive comments often reference specific entities, and identifying these can help differentiate them from technical descriptions, which may not reference entities in the same way.
5. **Preprocessing Techniques**: The paper describes various preprocessing techniques that can help clean and prepare the text for analysis. This includes removing code snippets, URLs, and other non-sentiment-related content, which can help isolate sentiment expressive text from technical descriptions.
6. **Manual Annotation**: The authors created a manually labeled dataset to train their sentiment analysis tool. This dataset includes comments that have been classified by human annotators, allowing the model to learn the distinctions between technical and sentiment expressive text based on real examples.
7. **Feature Extraction**: The use of feature extraction methods, such as TF-IDF or Doc2Vec, can help in identifying the characteristics of sentiment expressive text. By analyzing the features that are most indicative of sentiment, the model can better differentiate between technical and expressive content.
By implementing these strategies, the sentiment analysis tool can effectively distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text, leading to more accurate sentiment analysis in software engineering contexts.
