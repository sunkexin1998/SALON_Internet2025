Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial in software engineering sentiment analysis because technical texts often contain jargon and code snippets that do not convey sentiment. Accurate sentiment analysis requires focusing on expressive language to avoid misinterpretation and ensure relevant insights into developer sentiments.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering, the paper suggests several preprocessing steps. These include removing code snippets and programming keywords that do not express sentiment, expanding contractions, handling emoticons, and applying negation preprocessing to accurately capture sentiment context. Additionally, a customized stop-word list is used to filter out non-semantic words while retaining sentiment-relevant terms. By focusing on expressive language and eliminating technical jargon, the analysis can more accurately identify sentiments in code review comments, leading to better insights into developer attitudes.
