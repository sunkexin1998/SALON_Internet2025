To analyze sentiment in software engineering (SE) texts, the proposed SEntiMoji approach leverages emoji usage as noisy sentiment labels. This method involves two key stages: 
1. **Representation Learning**: It fine-tunes the DeepMoji model, initially trained on Twitter data, using emoji-labeled texts from GitHub to incorporate technical jargon. This allows the model to learn sentiment-aware representations that capture both general and domain-specific sentiment patterns.
2. **Sentiment Classification**: The learned representations are then used to train a sentiment classifier on a small amount of labeled SE-related data. This classifier predicts sentiment polarities (positive, negative, neutral) in SE texts, effectively addressing the challenges posed by the scarcity of labeled data and the unique language of software engineering.
By combining insights from both social media and technical platforms, SEntiMoji significantly improves sentiment analysis performance in SE tasks.
