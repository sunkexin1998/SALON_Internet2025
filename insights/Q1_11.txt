To analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, researchers should adopt tools specifically designed for the domain, such as SentiStrength-SE or Senti4SD, which are tailored for software-related data. It's crucial to evaluate the performance of these tools on the specific type of text being analyzed, as general-purpose sentiment analysis tools may yield unreliable results. Customization may involve retraining models with software-specific datasets to improve accuracy, particularly for detecting domain-specific vocabulary and handling nuances like irony or sarcasm. Additionally, aggregating feedback from multiple sources, such as app reviews and developer discussions, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of sentiment. Researchers should also consider using emotions instead of simple sentiment polarity for a richer analysis, while being aware of the challenges in identifying neutral sentiments and ensuring the quality of the training datasets.
