To analyze sentiment in software engineering (SE) texts, the paper proposes an integrated framework called EASTER, which combines a pre-trained transformer model (RoBERTa) for word embeddings with a convolutional neural network (TextCNN) for sentiment classification. The framework addresses the unique challenges of SE texts, such as indirect sentiment expression and complex sentence structures. RoBERTa captures contextual word meanings, while TextCNN processes these embeddings to classify sentiments into positive, neutral, or negative categories. Additionally, a residual connection is introduced to enhance cooperation between RoBERTa and TextCNN, improving model performance. Empirical evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that EASTER outperforms existing sentiment analysis tools, achieving better accuracy and generalizability across different SE text sources.
