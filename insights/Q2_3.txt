Sentiment expression in software engineering texts differs from general texts due to the use of technical jargon, word contractions, emoticons, URLs, and code snippets. These elements complicate sentiment analysis, necessitating customized tools to accurately interpret sentiments in code review comments and other software engineering communications.

To handle sentiment analysis in software engineering texts, the paper suggests several preprocessing steps: 
1. **Expansion of Contractions**: Replace shortened forms with their full versions.
2. **URL Removal**: Eliminate URLs that do not contribute to sentiment.
3. **Emoticon Handling**: Replace emoticons with corresponding sentiment words.
4. **Negation Preprocessing**: Identify and modify negated words to accurately reflect sentiment.
5. **Word Stemming**: Reduce words to their base forms.
6. **Stop-Word Removal**: Use a customized list to exclude non-semantic words.
7. **Code Snippet Removal**: Exclude programming keywords and identifiers that do not express sentiment. 
These steps enhance the accuracy of sentiment analysis in code review comments.
