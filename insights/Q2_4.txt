In software engineering texts, sentiment expressions differ from general domains due to the presence of code snippets, specific terminologies, and emojis. Developers often express positive sentiments towards individuals (e.g., gratitude) and negative sentiments towards projects (e.g., frustration), reflecting their collaborative and technical context.

To analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, the paper suggests several preprocessing steps: removing non-English characters, expanding contractions, and eliminating code snippets, URLs, and quotations. It also emphasizes stop words removal and processing emoticons to capture sentiment effectively. Additionally, negation handling is crucial, as it alters sentiment meaning. Feature vectorization methods like TF-IDF and Doc2Vec are employed to represent the texts, followed by supervised machine learning classifiers for sentiment classification. The approach also includes entity recognition to identify sentiments directed towards specific individuals or projects, ensuring a context-sensitive analysis tailored to the software engineering domain.
