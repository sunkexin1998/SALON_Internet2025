Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial in software engineering sentiment analysis because technical texts often contain jargon and factual information, while sentiment expressive texts convey emotions and opinions. Accurate sentiment analysis requires recognizing these differences to avoid misinterpretation and improve classification accuracy.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering sentiment analysis, the paper suggests employing a preprocessing module that removes non-essential features, such as code snippets and URLs, which are typical in technical texts. Additionally, it identifies subjective comments through sentiment classification, focusing on emotional language and expressions. The system classifies comments into categories (positive, negative, neutral) and recognizes entities (e.g., 'Person' or 'Project') to determine the sentiment's target. By analyzing the presence of emotional indicators and context, the system effectively differentiates between technical descriptions and sentiment-laden expressions.
