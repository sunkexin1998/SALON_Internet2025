The paper highlights that sentiment expression in software engineering texts often includes technical jargon and problem descriptions, leading to misclassifications by general sentiment analysis tools. Neutral technical texts are frequently misclassified as negative due to the presence of negative lexicon, reflecting a unique emotional context in developer communication.

To effectively analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, the paper suggests using a specialized classifier, Senti4SD, which is trained on domain-specific data from platforms like Stack Overflow. This classifier incorporates lexicon-based, keyword-based, and semantic features to accurately capture sentiment. It addresses the common issue of misclassifying neutral texts as negative by leveraging a gold standard of annotated posts. Additionally, employing word embedding techniques helps contextualize the meaning of words based on their usage, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of sentiment in technical communication, thus improving classification accuracy compared to off-the-shelf tools.
