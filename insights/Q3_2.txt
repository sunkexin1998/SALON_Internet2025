Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment-expressive text is crucial in software engineering sentiment analysis because SE texts often contain indirect and dispersed sentiment expressions. Recognizing this difference allows for more accurate sentiment detection, improving the reliability of analysis tools that may misinterpret technical language as sentiment.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment-expressive text in software engineering (SE) texts, the proposed approach utilizes specific filter rules based on sentence structures. These rules identify patterns indicating sentiment, such as direct sentiment expressions (e.g., exclamations, emojis), decorated sentiment (adverbs modifying sentiment words), and first-person expressions. Additionally, it filters out clauses that do not express sentiment, such as those in subjunctive mood or containing polysemous words used in a technical context. By applying these heuristics, the analysis can effectively isolate sentiment-expressive segments from technical descriptions, enhancing sentiment detection accuracy.
