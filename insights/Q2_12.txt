Sentiment expression in software engineering texts varies based on context, with stakeholders conveying emotions through reviews, comments, and discussions. Differences arise from subjective interpretations, labeling inconsistencies, and the presence of polar facts, which can lead to misclassifications in sentiment analysis tasks.

To effectively analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, it is crucial to employ domain-specific approaches. This includes developing tailored prompt templates for large language models (LLMs) to enhance their understanding of context. Additionally, ensuring consistency in labeling practices among human annotators can mitigate subjective interpretations. Utilizing larger, balanced datasets for training can improve model performance, while leveraging few-shot learning techniques can help when labeled data is scarce. Regularly refining prompts based on empirical results and conducting thorough error analyses can further enhance sentiment classification accuracy in software engineering contexts.
