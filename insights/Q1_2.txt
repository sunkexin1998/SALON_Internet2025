To analyze sentiment in software engineering (SE) texts, the proposed approach, SESSION, utilizes a three-step process. First, it preprocesses and segments the SE text into clauses using natural language processing tools. Second, it applies filter rules based on specific sentence structures to identify clauses likely to express sentiment, ignoring those that do not fit defined patterns. These patterns include direct sentiment expressions, decorated sentiments with adverbs, and judgment patterns. Finally, it employs adjustment rules to enhance sentiment analysis results, addressing issues like subjunctive mood and polysemous words. This method improves upon traditional dictionary-based tools by focusing on the unique expression of sentiments in SE texts, leading to better accuracy and generalizability compared to existing sentiment analysis tools.
