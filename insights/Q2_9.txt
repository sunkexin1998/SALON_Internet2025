In software engineering texts, sentiment expression differs from general contexts due to domain-specific terminology and jargon. Terms may carry different emotional weights, leading to challenges in sentiment analysis, particularly in recognizing irony or sarcasm, which can alter the intended sentiment significantly compared to non-technical communication.

To effectively analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, it is crucial to adapt sentiment analysis tools specifically for the domain. This includes training models on domain-specific datasets, such as those from GitHub or Stack Overflow, to capture the unique terminology and context. Additionally, employing consistent labeling methods, such as using established emotion models like the Plutchik model or the PANAS scale, can help mitigate subjectivity in sentiment labeling. Addressing challenges like sarcasm and irony through advanced natural language processing techniques is also essential to improve accuracy and reliability in sentiment analysis within software engineering contexts.
