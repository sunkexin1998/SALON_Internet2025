Sentiment expression in software engineering texts often includes technical jargon and implicit sentiments, which can lead to misclassifications by standard sentiment analysis tools. Additionally, emotions may be conveyed through emojis, reflecting both specific technical contexts and general emotional patterns, complicating sentiment detection in this domain.

To effectively analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, the paper suggests leveraging a combination of domain-specific and general sentiment data. This involves using emoji-labeled data from social media (like Twitter) to capture general emotional expressions, while also incorporating technical jargon from developer platforms (like GitHub). The proposed SEntiMoji approach fine-tunes a pre-trained model (DeepMoji) on GitHub data to adapt it for software engineering contexts. This dual approach helps to address the challenges posed by technical language and enhances the accuracy of sentiment classification by integrating broader emotional patterns alongside specific technical terms.
