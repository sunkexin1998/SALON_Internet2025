The paper emphasizes the need to distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in the context of sentiment analysis for software engineering (SE) texts for several reasons:
1. **Different Purposes**: Technical descriptive text typically conveys information about code, algorithms, or system behavior, while sentiment expressive text conveys the author's feelings or attitudes towards a particular aspect of the code or the review process. Mixing these two types of text can lead to misinterpretation of the sentiment expressed.
2. **Presence of Technical Jargon**: SE communication often includes technical jargon, code snippets, and other domain-specific language that does not carry sentiment. Sentiment analysis tools that do not account for this can misclassify neutral or technical comments as having sentiment, leading to inaccurate results.
3. **Impact on Sentiment Analysis Accuracy**: The presence of technical terms and structures in SE texts can confuse standard sentiment analysis tools, which are typically trained on more general datasets (like social media or product reviews). This can result in poor performance when analyzing SE texts, as these tools may not effectively differentiate between sentiment-laden comments and purely technical descriptions.
4. **Customization Requirement**: The paper argues that sentiment analysis tools need to be customized for specific domains, such as SE, to accurately capture the nuances of sentiment in the context of code reviews. This customization includes recognizing and appropriately handling technical language and structures that are prevalent in SE communication.
5. **Negation and Context**: The paper highlights that negation and context play significant roles in determining sentiment. In technical discussions, the meaning of a comment can change dramatically based on the presence of negation or the specific context in which technical terms are used. Therefore, a nuanced approach is necessary to accurately assess sentiment.
In summary, distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial for improving the accuracy and reliability of sentiment analysis in the software engineering domain, as it allows for a more tailored approach that considers the unique characteristics of SE communication.

The paper outlines several strategies to distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text when analyzing sentiment in software engineering (SE) texts, particularly in the context of code reviews. Here are the key approaches mentioned:
1. **Manual Labeling**: The authors created a sentiment oracle by manually labeling a dataset of code review comments. This involved categorizing comments as 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral' based on the perceived sentiment. This manual labeling helps establish a clear distinction between technical descriptions and sentiment-laden comments.
2. **Negation Handling**: The paper emphasizes the importance of accurately processing negations, as they can significantly alter the sentiment of a statement. The authors developed a negation preprocessing method that identifies negation phrases and modifies the sentiment of the words that follow. This helps in distinguishing between a neutral technical statement and a sentiment-expressive comment that includes negation.
3. **Data Preprocessing Techniques**: The authors implemented several preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the text for analysis:
   - **Expansion of Contractions**: This helps standardize the text and reduce ambiguity.
   - **URL Removal**: Since URLs do not contribute to sentiment, removing them helps focus on the sentiment-expressive content.
   - **Emoticon Handling**: Emoticons are replaced with words representing their sentiment polarity, which helps capture sentiment in informal communications.
   - **Stop-Word Removal**: A customized list of stop-words is used to filter out non-semantic words that do not contribute to sentiment, while retaining words that may be significant in expressing sentiment.
4. **Feature Vector Generation**: The authors used TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to extract features for classification. By focusing on words that appear in a sufficient number of comments, they can better capture the sentiment-expressive content while filtering out technical jargon that may not be relevant.
5. **Training on Domain-Specific Data**: The paper highlights the need for sentiment analysis tools to be trained on datasets that are specific to the SE domain. This ensures that the models can learn the unique characteristics of sentiment expression in code reviews, as opposed to relying on models trained on general datasets.
6. **Evaluation of Sentiment Analysis Tools**: The authors evaluated existing sentiment analysis tools on their SE dataset to identify their strengths and weaknesses. This evaluation helps in understanding how well these tools can differentiate between technical and sentiment-expressive text.
By employing these strategies, the authors aim to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis in the software engineering domain, ensuring that technical descriptions do not interfere with the identification of sentiment in code review comments.
