Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial in sentiment analysis for software engineering (SE) for several reasons:
1. **Nature of Content**: Technical descriptive texts often contain domain-specific jargon, technical terms, and factual information that may not convey sentiment directly. In contrast, sentiment expressive texts are more likely to contain emotional language, opinions, and subjective expressions. Misclassifying technical descriptions as sentiment can lead to inaccurate sentiment analysis results.
2. **Misunderstanding of Technical Jargon**: The paper highlights that commonly used sentiment analysis tools struggle with SE texts due to the misunderstanding of technical jargon. This misunderstanding can lead to misclassifications, as the sentiment analysis tools may not recognize the context in which certain terms are used. For example, a term that is neutral in a technical context may be interpreted as negative or positive in a general context.
3. **Sentiment Detection Challenges**: The presence of sentiment in SE-related discussions can be subtle and implicit. Technical texts may include phrases that appear neutral but carry underlying sentiments. For instance, a statement that describes a technical issue may implicitly express frustration or satisfaction. Therefore, separating technical descriptions from sentiment expressions helps in accurately identifying and interpreting these sentiments.
4. **Improving Analysis Quality**: By distinguishing between the two types of texts, researchers can develop more tailored sentiment analysis methods that account for the unique characteristics of SE language. This can lead to improved performance in sentiment classification, as the models can be trained to recognize and appropriately handle the nuances of both technical and sentiment-laden texts.
5. **Contextual Relevance**: The context in which a sentiment is expressed can significantly affect its interpretation. Technical discussions often involve collaborative problem-solving, where the sentiment may be tied to specific issues or artifacts. Understanding the context helps in accurately capturing the sentiment related to specific technical discussions, which is essential for project managers and developers to gauge team morale and productivity.
In summary, distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is essential for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of sentiment analysis in software engineering, as it allows for a more nuanced understanding of the sentiments expressed in technical discussions.

The paper suggests several approaches to distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text when analyzing sentiment in software engineering (SE) texts:
1. **Contextual Analysis**: Understanding the context in which the text is written is crucial. Technical descriptive texts often focus on specific technical details, processes, or functionalities, while sentiment expressive texts typically convey opinions, emotions, or subjective evaluations. Analyzing the surrounding context can help identify whether the text is primarily technical or sentiment-driven.
2. **Keyword and Phrase Identification**: Developing a list of keywords and phrases that are indicative of sentiment can help in distinguishing sentiment expressive texts from technical descriptions. For example, words like "love," "hate," "frustrating," or "great" are more likely to appear in sentiment expressive texts, while terms like "function," "method," "error," or "implementation" are more characteristic of technical descriptions.
3. **Sentiment Lexicons**: Utilizing sentiment lexicons that are tailored for the software engineering domain can aid in identifying sentiment-laden words and phrases. These lexicons can help in recognizing emotional expressions within the text, allowing for a clearer distinction between technical and sentiment-driven content.
4. **Machine Learning Models**: Training machine learning models specifically designed to classify texts as either technical or sentiment expressive can be effective. These models can learn from labeled datasets that include examples of both types of texts, enabling them to recognize patterns and features that differentiate the two.
5. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques**: Employing NLP techniques such as part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition can help in analyzing the structure and components of the text. For instance, sentiment expressive texts may contain more adjectives and adverbs that convey emotions, while technical texts may have a higher frequency of nouns and verbs related to processes and functionalities.
6. **Emoji and Emoticon Analysis**: The paper highlights the use of emojis as indicators of sentiment. Analyzing the presence and context of emojis or emoticons in the text can provide clues about the sentiment being expressed. For example, a positive emoji in a GitHub comment may indicate a sentiment expressive text, while its absence may suggest a more technical focus.
7. **Sentiment Scoring**: Implementing sentiment scoring mechanisms can help quantify the sentiment expressed in the text. Texts with high sentiment scores can be classified as sentiment expressive, while those with low or neutral scores may be categorized as technical descriptive.
By combining these approaches, researchers and practitioners can more effectively distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering, leading to improved sentiment analysis outcomes.
