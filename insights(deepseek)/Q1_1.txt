To analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, the paper proposes using **SentiStrength-SE**, a domain-specific sentiment analysis tool. This tool is built on top of **SentiStrength** but incorporates a **domain-specific dictionary** and **heuristics** tailored for software engineering. The process involves:
1. **Domain Dictionary Creation**: A dictionary is developed using software engineering-specific terms from commit messages, issue comments, and other textual artifacts. Words with domain-specific meanings (e.g., "error," "fix") are neutralized to avoid misinterpretation.
2. **Heuristics Integration**: Heuristics are added to handle context-sensitive words, negations, and proper nouns. A preprocessing phase filters out non-sentimental content like code snippets and URLs.
3. **Sentiment Detection**: The tool computes sentiment scores for text, distinguishing between positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. It outperforms general-purpose tools like **NLTK**, **Stanford NLP**, and the original **SentiStrength** in accuracy for software engineering texts.
