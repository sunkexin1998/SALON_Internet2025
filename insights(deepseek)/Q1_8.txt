To analyze sentiment for software engineering (SE) texts, the paper recommends using SE-specific sentiment analysis tools, as general-purpose tools often underperform in this domain. Four SE-specific tools are highlighted: Senti4SD and SentiCR, which use supervised machine learning, and SentiStrength-SE and DEVA, which employ lexicon-based approaches. The study emphasizes the importance of domain-specific tuning for enhanced accuracy, suggesting that supervised tools should be retrained on platform-specific datasets to account for platform-specific jargon and communication styles. In the absence of a gold standard for retraining, lexicon-based tools are recommended. The paper also advises building a robust gold standard with substantial inter-rater agreement and selecting the appropriate tool based on the research goals, ensuring alignment with the sentiment conceptualization of the target platform.
