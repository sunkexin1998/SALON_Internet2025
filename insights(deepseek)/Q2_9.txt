The paper highlights that sentiment expression in software engineering (SE) texts differs from general texts due to domain-specific terminology and context. For example, terms like "bug" or "crash" may carry negative sentiments in SE but are neutral or positive in other contexts, complicating sentiment analysis in SE.

To handle sentiment analysis in software engineering (SE) texts, domain-specific adaptations are crucial. Tools like SentiStrength-SE and Senti4SD are tailored for SE, leveraging domain-specific lexicons and machine learning models trained on SE data (e.g., GitHub, JIRA). Additionally, combining multiple tools or using neural networks like BERT can improve cross-platform performance. Addressing subjectivity in labeling and handling sarcasm/irony remain challenges, requiring further research and standardized emotion models (e.g., Plutchik or PANAS) for consistent sentiment annotation.
