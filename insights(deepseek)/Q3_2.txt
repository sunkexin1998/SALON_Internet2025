We should distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering (SE) texts because sentiments in SE texts are often indirect and dispersed. Authors typically describe issues in detail before expressing sentiments, making it necessary to filter out neutral, technical clauses to accurately identify and analyze sentiments.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering (SE) texts, the paper proposes using **sentence structures** and **filter rules**. Specifically, it segments the text into clauses and applies patterns such as **Direct Sentiment Pattern**, **Decorated Sentiment Pattern**, **"About Me" Pattern**, and **"Judgement" Pattern** to identify clauses likely expressing sentiments. Additionally, it filters out technical text (e.g., words in brackets, code fragments) and ignores subjunctive clauses. This approach ensures that only clauses expressing sentiments are analyzed, improving the accuracy of sentiment analysis in SE texts.
