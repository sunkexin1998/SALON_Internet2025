The paper highlights that software engineering texts often contain domain-specific jargon and conventions, leading to differences in sentiment expression. General-purpose sentiment analysis tools may misclassify technical terms (e.g., "kill" or "save") as negative or positive, whereas SE-specific tools are better at recognizing neutral sentiment in technical contexts.

To handle sentiment analysis in software engineering texts, the paper recommends using SE-specific sentiment analysis tools, as they are fine-tuned for technical jargon and domain-specific semantics. If possible, retrain these tools on platform-specific datasets to improve accuracy. Additionally, perform a sanity check to ensure the tool aligns with research goals, and consider using an ensemble of multiple tools with majority voting to enhance performance. For longer texts, model mixed sentiment explicitly, as they may convey both positive and negative emotions. Finally, be cautious of the unit of analysis, as sentiment classification may vary with document length.
