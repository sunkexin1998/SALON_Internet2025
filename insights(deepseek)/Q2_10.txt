Sentiment expression in software engineering (SE) texts is more indirect and dispersed compared to general texts. Developers often describe technical issues before expressing sentiments, leading to misclassification of neutral technical terms as negative and complex sentence structures with non-sentimental clauses. This makes sentiment analysis in SE texts particularly challenging.

To handle sentiment analysis in software engineering (SE) texts, the paper proposes incorporating pre-trained transformer models like RoBERTa into TextCNN. RoBERTa provides contextual word embeddings, while TextCNN captures implicit sentiment expressions through convolutional layers. Additionally, residual connections are introduced to enhance cooperation between RoBERTa and TextCNN. This approach improves accuracy and generalizability by better understanding the unique, indirect sentiment expressions in SE texts, such as technical descriptions and complex sentence structures, compared to traditional sentiment analysis tools. The framework is evaluated on multiple SE datasets, showing superior performance over baseline methods.
