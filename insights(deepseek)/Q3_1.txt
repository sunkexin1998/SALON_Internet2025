We should distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering because technical terms often have neutral meanings in this domain, despite having emotional connotations in general language. Misinterpreting these terms can lead to inaccurate sentiment analysis, as they do not convey actual sentiments in technical contexts.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering, the paper suggests creating a domain-specific dictionary that neutralizes technical terms (e.g., "error," "support") which may carry emotional connotations in general language but are neutral in technical contexts. Additionally, contextual cues, such as the presence of pronouns (e.g., "I," "we") or neutralizers (e.g., "would," "could"), help identify sentiment-expressive text. Preprocessing steps, like filtering out code snippets and numeric values, further aid in isolating sentiment-expressive content. These methods ensure accurate sentiment analysis by focusing on text that genuinely conveys emotions.
