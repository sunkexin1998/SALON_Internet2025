The paper does not explicitly mention the need to distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text. However, it emphasizes the importance of domain-specific tuning and platform-specific retraining for sentiment analysis tools to accurately detect emotions in software engineering texts, suggesting that technical jargon and communication styles vary across platforms.

The paper does not provide explicit methods for distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text. However, it highlights the importance of using model-driven annotation guidelines grounded in theoretical emotion models (e.g., Shaver's framework) to identify sentiment. Sentiment expressive text typically contains emotional cues (e.g., positive/negative words, emoticons), while technical descriptive text focuses on factual or neutral content. Tools like Senti4SD and SentiStrength-SE leverage lexicons and machine learning to detect sentiment, but platform-specific retraining is recommended to account for domain-specific jargon and communication styles, which may blur the line between technical and sentiment-expressive text.
