Technical descriptive text is often neutral and lacks sentiment, while sentiment expressive text conveys emotions or opinions. Distinguishing between them ensures accurate sentiment analysis, as technical content can skew results if not separated, leading to misclassification of neutral messages as positive or negative. This distinction improves the reliability of sentiment analysis tools.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text, the paper suggests using pre-classification tools like **SentiStrengthSE** to filter messages into positive, negative, and neutral categories. Technical messages, often neutral, are identified and separated from sentiment-expressive ones. Additionally, manual labeling by experts, guided by established emotion models (e.g., Shaverâ€™s model), helps differentiate subtle sentiment in expressive text. This ensures accurate classification, as technical content (e.g., code reviews) is less likely to convey emotions, while expressive text (e.g., discussions) may contain sentiment. Combining automated tools and expert validation improves the distinction.
