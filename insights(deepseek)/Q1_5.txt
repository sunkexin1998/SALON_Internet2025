The paper proposes SEntiMoji, an emoji-powered learning approach for sentiment analysis in software engineering (SE) texts. The method leverages emotional emojis as noisy sentiment labels to learn sentiment-aware representations of SE-related texts. It uses a two-stage process: 
1. **Representation Learning**: Fine-tunes the DeepMoji model, pre-trained on Tweets, using emoji-labeled GitHub posts to incorporate technical jargon. This results in DeepMoji-SE, a sentiment-aware representation model tailored for SE texts.
2. **Sentiment Classification**: Uses DeepMoji-SE to generate vector representations of labeled SE texts, which are then used to train a final sentiment classifier. This approach combines general sentiment patterns from Tweets with domain-specific knowledge from GitHub posts and manually labeled SE data, achieving significant improvements over existing sentiment analysis methods in SE.
