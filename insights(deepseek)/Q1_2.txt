To analyze sentiment in software engineering (SE) texts, the paper proposes a three-step approach called SESSION (SentEnce-Structure-based SentIment analysis for sOftware eNgineering). First, the SE text is preprocessed and segmented into clauses using Stanford CoreNLP. Second, filter rules are applied to identify whether a sentence expresses sentiment by matching patterns such as direct sentiment, decorated sentiment, "About Me," or "Judgement" patterns. Third, adjust rules are used to refine sentiment analysis by recognizing subjunctive moods, identifying polysemous words, and handling negations. This approach leverages sentence structures to improve accuracy, outperforming baseline methods like SentiStrength, SentiStrength-SE, and Senti4SD, and is more generalizable across different SE datasets.
