Sentiment expression in software engineering (SE) texts differs due to the presence of technical jargon and domain-specific meanings, which out-of-the-box sentiment analysis tools often misinterpret. SE texts also contain implicit sentiments, sentimental words in neutral contexts, and long, complex sentences, making sentiment analysis more challenging compared to general texts.

To handle sentiment analysis in software engineering (SE) texts, the paper proposes SEntiMoji, an emoji-powered learning approach. It leverages emotional emojis as noisy sentiment labels from both Tweets and GitHub posts to learn sentiment-aware representations. This method incorporates general sentimental patterns from Tweets and technical jargon from GitHub, combined with labeled SE-related data, to train a sentiment classifier. This approach addresses the scarcity of labeled SE data and improves sentiment analysis accuracy by capturing both domain-specific and general sentimental expressions.
