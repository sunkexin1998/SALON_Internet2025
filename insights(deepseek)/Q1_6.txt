To analyze sentiment for software engineering texts, the paper proposes **Senti4SD**, a classifier specifically trained for sentiment analysis in developers' communication channels. It leverages a combination of **lexicon-based features** (using sentiment lexicons like SentiStrength), **keyword-based features** (n-grams, emoticons, etc.), and **semantic features** (based on word embedding models like word2vec). The classifier is trained on a manually annotated gold standard of Stack Overflow posts, which includes questions, answers, and comments labeled for sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral). Senti4SD reduces misclassifications of neutral and positive posts as negative, improving precision and recall compared to off-the-shelf tools like SentiStrength. The approach is validated through empirical evaluation, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling technical jargon and problem reports in software engineering texts.
