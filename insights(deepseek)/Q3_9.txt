The distinction is necessary because technical descriptive text in software engineering often contains domain-specific terms that may be misinterpreted as negative sentiment by general sentiment analysis tools, leading to inaccurate results. Tailored tools for SE can better handle these nuances, improving sentiment detection accuracy.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering, sentiment analysis tools should be adapted to the SE domain. This involves training models on SE-specific datasets (e.g., GitHub, JIRA, Stack Overflow) and incorporating domain-specific lexicons or heuristics. Additionally, tools can leverage machine learning approaches like SVM or neural networks to better identify sentiment in context, filtering out technical jargon that may be misclassified as negative sentiment. Cross-validation with human-labeled data can further refine the distinction, ensuring accurate sentiment detection in SE texts.
