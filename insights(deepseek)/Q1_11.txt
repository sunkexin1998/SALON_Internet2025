To analyze sentiment for software engineering texts, researchers often use sentiment analysis tools that are either general-purpose or specifically tailored for software engineering (SE) contexts. General-purpose tools like SentiStrength, NLTK, and Stanford CoreNLP are commonly used but may require customization for SE data due to domain-specific vocabulary and context. SE-specific tools like Senti4SD, SentiStrength-SE, and SEntiMoji are trained on SE-related datasets (e.g., Stack Overflow posts, issue reports) and often perform better in this domain. Key steps include:
1. **Tool Selection**: Choose a tool based on the type of SE text (e.g., app reviews, issue reports).
2. **Customization**: Retrain or fine-tune tools using SE-specific datasets to improve accuracy.
3. **Evaluation**: Validate tool performance using manually annotated SE datasets to ensure reliability.
4. **Context Awareness**: Address challenges like irony, sarcasm, and domain-specific terms by incorporating SE lexicons or hybrid approaches combining machine learning and rule-based methods.
This approach ensures more accurate sentiment analysis in SE contexts.
