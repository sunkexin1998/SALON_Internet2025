Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because technical descriptions often contain domain-specific vocabulary that can mislead sentiment analysis tools, leading to incorrect sentiment classification. This separation ensures more accurate sentiment analysis by focusing on text that genuinely expresses emotions or opinions.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text, clear guidelines are needed for data labeling. Evaluators should focus on identifying objective reports of facts (e.g., "there is a bug") versus affective states (e.g., "I am frustrated"). Multi-annotator validation and conflict resolution (e.g., majority voting or discussion) can help ensure accurate classification. Additionally, leveraging domain-specific lexicons or pre-trained models tailored for software engineering contexts can improve the distinction between technical and sentiment-laden text. This approach minimizes misclassification and enhances the reliability of sentiment analysis in software engineering tasks.
