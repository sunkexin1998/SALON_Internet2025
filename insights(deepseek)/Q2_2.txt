The differences in sentiment expression in software engineering (SE) texts compared to social texts are:
1. **Fewer Sentiments**: SE texts express fewer sentiments overall.
2. **Indirect and Dispersed**: Sentiments in SE texts are more indirect and dispersed, often embedded in detailed descriptions of issues.
3. **Complex Sentence Structures**: SE texts use longer, more complex sentences, making sentiment analysis more challenging.

To handle sentiment analysis in software engineering (SE) texts, the paper proposes:
1. **Preprocessing and Segmentation**: Use tools like Stanford CoreNLP to segment SE texts into clauses and tag parts of speech.
2. **Filter Rules**: Identify clauses likely to express sentiments using patterns like Direct Sentiment, Decorated Sentiment, "About Me," and "Judgement" patterns.
3. **Adjust Rules**: Enhance sentiment analysis by recognizing subjunctive moods, identifying polysemous words, and handling negations more accurately.
These steps help address the indirect, dispersed, and complex nature of sentiment expression in SE texts.
