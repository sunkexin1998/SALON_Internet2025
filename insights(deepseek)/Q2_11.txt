In software engineering texts, sentiment expression differs due to domain-specific vocabulary, irony, sarcasm, and mixed emotions. General-purpose sentiment analysis tools often misclassify sentiments, especially neutral ones, and struggle with negations and decreasing comparative terms. Customized tools for SE data perform better but still face challenges in accurately capturing nuanced sentiments.

To handle sentiment analysis in software engineering texts, it is recommended to:
1. **Use Domain-Specific Tools**: Employ sentiment analysis tools specifically trained on software engineering data, such as Senti4SD or SentiStrength-SE.
2. **Validate Performance**: Always verify the tool's performance on the specific dataset before use.
3. **Pre-Train Models**: Leverage pre-trained models with a mix of general and SE-specific data to improve accuracy.
4. **Handle Negations and Irony**: Implement techniques to detect and process negations, irony, and sarcasm.
5. **Balance Datasets**: Use balancing techniques like oversampling or undersampling to address the dominance of neutral texts.
6. **Clear Labeling Guidelines**: Ensure clear guidelines for human annotators to reduce subjectivity in labeled datasets.
