Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because technical jargon and domain-specific semantics in software engineering can be misinterpreted by general-purpose sentiment analysis tools, leading to unreliable results. SE-specific tools are better equipped to handle this distinction, improving accuracy in sentiment analysis.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering, SE-specific sentiment analysis tools are employed. These tools are fine-tuned to recognize domain-specific semantics and jargon, reducing misclassifications of technical terms as sentiment-laden words. Manual annotation guidelines and theoretical models of affect are used to create gold standards for training and validating these tools, ensuring they accurately identify sentiment in the context of software development discussions. Additionally, tools may leverage features like Bag of Words, sentiment lexicons, and semantic features based on word embedding to improve their ability to differentiate between technical and sentiment-expressive content.
