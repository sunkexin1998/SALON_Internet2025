Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because technical terms (e.g., "kill," "critical") in software engineering texts can be misclassified as negative sentiments, leading to inaccurate sentiment analysis. This distinction helps avoid misclassification and ensures more reliable sentiment detection in SE contexts.

The paper suggests distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text by leveraging pre-trained transformer models like RoBERTa, which capture contextual nuances, and combining them with TextCNN to analyze sentence structures. This approach helps identify indirect sentiment expressions in SE texts, such as recognizing neutral technical descriptions (e.g., "critical issue") versus genuine sentiment (e.g., frustration or satisfaction). Additionally, heuristic-based methods, like SE-specific dictionaries or filter-adjust rules, can be used to refine sentiment analysis by accounting for domain-specific language and sentence structures, ensuring accurate classification of sentiments in software engineering contexts.
