Technical descriptive text in software engineering often includes jargon, code snippets, and URLs, which do not express sentiments. Sentiment expressive text, however, conveys emotions or attitudes. Distinguishing between them ensures accurate sentiment analysis by focusing on text that genuinely reflects sentiments, avoiding misclassification due to non-sentiment-related technical content.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering, the paper suggests preprocessing steps such as removing code snippets, URLs, and programming keywords, which are non-sentiment-related. Additionally, it identifies and retains sentiment-expressive elements like emoticons, negation phrases, and contractions. By filtering out technical jargon and focusing on linguistic features that convey emotions (e.g., adjectives, adverbs, and verbs in negated contexts), the analysis ensures that only sentiment-expressive text is considered. This approach improves the accuracy of sentiment analysis by isolating text that genuinely reflects sentiments rather than technical descriptions.
