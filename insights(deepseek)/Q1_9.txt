Sentiment analysis for software engineering (SE) texts involves using tools and techniques to detect and classify emotions or sentiments expressed in text-based communication within software development contexts. The most common approaches include:
1. **Machine Learning Models**: Tools like Senti4SD and SentiCR use machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes to classify sentiments in SE-specific texts like GitHub comments or JIRA issues. These models are trained on labeled datasets from platforms like GitHub, Stack Overflow, or JIRA.
2. **Lexicon-Based Tools**: Tools like SentiStrength and SentiStrength-SE use predefined lexicons to detect sentiment strength in text without requiring training. These tools are adapted to the SE domain to handle technical jargon.
3. **Neural Networks**: Advanced models like BERT and RoBERTa, pre-trained on large datasets, are fine-tuned for SE texts to improve sentiment classification accuracy.
Challenges include handling domain-specific language, irony/sarcasm, and subjective labeling of data.
