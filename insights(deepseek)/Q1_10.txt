The paper proposes a training framework named EASTER (sEntiment Analysis on SE texts based on TExtcnn and RoBERTa) for sentiment analysis on software engineering (SE) texts. The framework incorporates the pre-trained transformer model RoBERTa for word embedding and TextCNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for downstream sentiment classification. RoBERTa is chosen for its optimized performance and ability to handle longer sequences, which is suitable for the indirect and dispersed sentiment expression in SE texts. TextCNN is used to explore semantics from groups of adjacent words in sentences, aiding in capturing implicit sentiment expressions. Additionally, residual connections are introduced between RoBERTa and TextCNN to enhance cooperation. The framework is trained on a dataset of 4423 Stack Overflow posts and evaluated on four datasets from different software information sites, demonstrating improved accuracy and generalizability compared to baseline approaches.
