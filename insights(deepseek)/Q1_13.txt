Sentiment analysis for software engineering (SE) texts involves classifying the sentiment of developers' messages as positive, negative, or neutral. This is typically done using SE-specific sentiment analysis tools like SentiStrengthSE, Senti4SD, SentiCR, and DEVA, which are tailored to handle the unique language and context of SE discussions. These tools often employ lexicon-based, keyword-based, or machine learning approaches, sometimes incorporating semantic features or emotion models like Shaver's to guide classification. The process includes collecting and pre-processing text data from platforms like GitHub, manually labeling messages with the help of experts, and then applying the tools to classify the sentiment. Performance is evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F-score. The goal is to detect sentiments that may impact software development, such as those influencing bug fixes or pull request acceptance.
