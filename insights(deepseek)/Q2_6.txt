In software engineering texts, sentiment expression differs due to the frequent use of technical jargon and problem-related language, which can be misclassified as negative by general-purpose sentiment analysis tools. Positive sentiment often includes gratitude and enthusiasm, while negative sentiment may involve frustration or anger, requiring domain-specific tools for accurate detection.

To handle sentiment analysis in software engineering texts, the paper proposes using **Senti4SD**, a classifier specifically trained for developers' communication. It combines **lexicon-based features** (e.g., sentiment scores), **keyword-based features** (e.g., n-grams, emoticons), and **semantic features** (e.g., word embeddings) to address domain-specific challenges. This approach reduces misclassifications of neutral or positive posts as negative, leveraging a gold standard of annotated Stack Overflow posts for training. By incorporating domain-specific word embeddings and sentiment lexicons, Senti4SD improves precision and recall, particularly for neutral and negative sentiment, compared to off-the-shelf tools like SentiStrength.
