Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because technical texts often lack emotional content, while sentiment texts convey emotions. Mixing them can lead to inaccurate sentiment analysis, as technical terms and code snippets may be misinterpreted as emotional expressions, reducing the tool's effectiveness in identifying true sentiment.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text, preprocessing steps are applied. Code snippets, URLs, and quotations are removed to isolate sentiment-expressive content. Emoticons, punctuation marks, and negation words are processed to capture emotional cues. Stop words specific to software engineering (e.g., "windows" or "chrome") are filtered out. This separation ensures that technical terms and code do not interfere with sentiment analysis, allowing the tool to focus on emotional expressions like gratitude, frustration, or agreement, which are more relevant for understanding developers' sentiments in issue comments.
