Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because technical jargon in software engineering can be misinterpreted by general sentiment analysis tools, leading to unreliable results. Technical texts often contain domain-specific meanings that require specialized understanding to accurately identify sentiment.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text, the paper suggests leveraging domain-specific knowledge and general sentimental patterns. Technical descriptive text often contains jargon and factual information, while sentiment expressive text conveys emotions or opinions. The proposed approach, SEntiMoji, uses emoji-labeled posts from GitHub (technical domain) and Twitter (general domain) to learn sentiment-aware representations, capturing both technical jargon and general sentiment expressions. This helps in accurately identifying sentiment in software engineering texts by incorporating domain-specific context and broader emotional cues.
