In software engineering texts, sentiment expression differs due to domain-specific meanings of technical terms, context-sensitive variations, and the presence of neutralized words in technical contexts. Words like "error" or "support" may carry sentiment in general English but are neutral in software engineering, leading to misinterpretations by general sentiment analysis tools.

To handle sentiment analysis in software engineering texts, the paper suggests creating a domain-specific dictionary tailored to the technical context, which neutralizes words that are typically emotional in general English but neutral in software engineering. Additionally, it recommends incorporating heuristics to address context-sensitive variations, negation handling, and preprocessing steps to filter out non-sentimental content like code snippets. These domain-specific techniques, implemented in the tool SentiStrength-SE, significantly improve sentiment analysis accuracy by addressing the unique challenges of software engineering texts.
