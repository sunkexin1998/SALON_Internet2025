To analyze sentiment for software engineering (SE) texts, it is recommended to use SE-specific sentiment analysis tools rather than general-purpose tools, as the latter often fail to accurately capture the domain-specific jargon and semantics. SE-specific tools like Senti4SD, SentiStrength-SE, DEV A, and SentiCR are designed to handle technical language and developer communication. These tools can be used off-the-shelf, but for better accuracy, retraining or fine-tuning on a relevant gold standard dataset is advised. Additionally, performing a sanity check to ensure the tool aligns with the research goals is crucial. If retraining is not feasible, using an ensemble of multiple tools with a majority voting system can improve performance. The choice of the unit of analysis (e.g., individual comments vs. entire discussions) also impacts results, with shorter texts generally yielding better agreement. Finally, be aware of challenges like implicit sentiment, figurative language, and mixed polarity in longer texts.
