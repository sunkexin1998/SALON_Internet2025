To analyze sentiment in software engineering (SE) texts, the proposed approach, SESSION, utilizes a three-step process. First, it preprocesses and segments the SE text into clauses using natural language processing tools. Second, it applies filter rules based on sentence structures to identify clauses likely to express sentiment, ignoring those that do not fit specific patterns (e.g., subjunctive clauses). Third, it employs adjustment rules to enhance sentiment scores derived from a dictionary-based tool, SentiStrength, without modifying its dictionary. This method accounts for the unique, indirect, and dispersed expression of sentiments in SE texts, improving accuracy and generalizability compared to traditional sentiment analysis tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SESSION outperforms existing dictionary-based and learning-based approaches in analyzing sentiments in SE texts.
