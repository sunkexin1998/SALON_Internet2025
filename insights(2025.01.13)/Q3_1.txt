Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because technical terms often carry neutral or domain-specific meanings that can mislead sentiment analysis tools. Accurate sentiment detection in software engineering requires recognizing the context and emotional intent behind the language used in comments and discussions.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering, one can analyze the context in which words are used. This involves identifying domain-specific jargon that may appear neutral or technical but lacks emotional intent. Additionally, employing a domain-specific sentiment dictionary can help classify words based on their emotional connotations within the software engineering context. Heuristics can also be applied to detect sentiment by considering the presence of emotional expressions, negations, and contextual cues, such as pronouns that indicate personal feelings or opinions, thereby enhancing the accuracy of sentiment analysis in technical discussions.
