Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment-expressive text is crucial in software engineering sentiment analysis because SE texts often express sentiments indirectly and dispersedly. This complexity necessitates identifying relevant clauses to accurately capture sentiments, as traditional sentiment analysis tools may misinterpret technical language as sentiment, leading to unreliable results.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment-expressive text in software engineering (SE) texts, the proposed approach utilizes specific filter rules based on sentence structures. These rules identify patterns indicating sentiment, such as direct sentiment expressions (e.g., exclamations, emojis), decorated sentiment (adverbs modifying sentiment words), and first-person expressions. Additionally, it filters out clauses that do not likely express sentiment, such as those in subjunctive mood or containing polysemous words used in a technical context. By applying these heuristics, the approach effectively isolates sentiment-expressive clauses from technical descriptions, enhancing sentiment analysis accuracy.
