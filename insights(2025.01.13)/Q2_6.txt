The paper highlights that sentiment expression in software engineering texts often includes technical jargon and problem descriptions, leading to misclassifications by general sentiment analysis tools. Neutral technical texts are frequently misclassified as negative due to the presence of negative lexicon, reflecting a unique emotional context in developer communication.

To effectively analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, the paper proposes using a specialized classifier, Senti4SD, which is trained on domain-specific data from Stack Overflow. This classifier incorporates lexicon-based, keyword-based, and semantic features to accurately capture sentiment. It addresses the common issue of misclassifying neutral texts as negative by leveraging a gold standard of annotated posts. By utilizing word embedding techniques to understand contextual meanings and employing a tailored approach to sentiment analysis, Senti4SD improves classification accuracy, particularly for neutral and negative sentiments, thus providing a more reliable analysis of developers' emotional expressions.
