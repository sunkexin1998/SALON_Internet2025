Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial in sentiment analysis for software engineering because technical jargon can obscure sentiment, leading to misclassifications. Understanding the context and emotional expressions helps improve the accuracy of sentiment detection, ensuring relevant insights for developers and project managers.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering sentiment analysis, the paper suggests leveraging both domain-specific knowledge and general sentiment patterns. This involves using labeled datasets that contain explicit sentiment expressions alongside technical jargon. By employing representation learning techniques, such as the SEntiMoji approach, which incorporates emoji usage data from platforms like GitHub and Twitter, the model can learn to identify sentiment in the context of technical discussions. This dual approach allows the model to recognize emotional cues while accounting for the unique language and expressions used in software engineering texts.
