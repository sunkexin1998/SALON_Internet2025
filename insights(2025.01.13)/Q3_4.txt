Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial in software engineering sentiment analysis because technical texts often contain jargon and factual information, while sentiment expressive texts convey emotions and opinions. Accurate sentiment analysis requires recognizing these differences to avoid misinterpretation and improve classification accuracy.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering sentiment analysis, the paper suggests employing a combination of preprocessing techniques and sentiment classification methods. This includes removing code snippets, URLs, and non-English characters to focus on pure text. Additionally, the use of sentiment classification algorithms helps identify subjective comments. The system, SentiSW, classifies comments into positive, negative, or neutral categories, allowing it to recognize sentiment-expressive texts. By analyzing the context and specific linguistic features, such as emoticons and sentiment-laden words, the system effectively differentiates between technical descriptions and emotional expressions.
