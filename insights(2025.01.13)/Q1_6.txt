To analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, the paper introduces Senti4SD, a classifier specifically designed for this domain. The process involves several key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of software-related texts, such as posts from Stack Overflow, which are then manually annotated for sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral).

2. **Feature Extraction**: Utilize a combination of lexicon-based features (e.g., sentiment scores from a lexicon), keyword-based features (n-grams, emoticons), and semantic features derived from word embeddings to capture the contextual meaning of words.

3. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), using the extracted features and the annotated dataset.

4. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance against a baseline tool (e.g., SentiStrength) to ensure improved accuracy in classifying sentiment, particularly addressing issues like the misclassification of neutral texts as negative.

This approach enhances sentiment analysis in the software engineering context by leveraging domain-specific characteristics.
