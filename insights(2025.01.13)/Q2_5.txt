Sentiment expression in software engineering texts often includes technical jargon and domain-specific language, which can lead to misinterpretations by standard sentiment analysis tools. Additionally, emotions may be conveyed implicitly or through emojis, making it essential to customize sentiment analysis methods to capture these unique expressions effectively.

To effectively analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, it is crucial to customize sentiment analysis methods to accommodate the unique characteristics of the domain. This involves leveraging labeled software engineering-related texts to capture technical jargon and employing large-scale emoji usage data from platforms like Twitter and GitHub to enhance sentiment representation. The proposed SEntiMoji approach fine-tunes a pre-trained model (DeepMoji) using emoji-labeled texts, allowing it to learn sentiment-aware representations that incorporate both technical language and general sentiment patterns. This dual approach improves the accuracy and reliability of sentiment analysis in software engineering contexts.
